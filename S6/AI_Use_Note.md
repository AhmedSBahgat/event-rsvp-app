# AI Use Note

GenAI tools used: ChatGPT (GPT family) and GitHub Copilot.

Where GenAI assisted:
- Drafted initial backlog user stories and Gherkin acceptance criteria, including negative/boundary cases.
- Suggested measurable NFRs and verification approaches.
- Generated a first-pass risk register and MoSCoW capacity calculations.

Representative prompts (paraphrased):
- "Generate 10 user stories for an event RSVP web app including Gherkin acceptance criteria with at least one negative case each."
- "Suggest 6 measurable non-functional requirements (performance, availability, security, data portability) and propose verification methods."
- "List 6 campus-app specific risks across technical, schedule, and compliance lenses with first-action mitigations."

What I accepted and edited:
- I selected relevant stories and tightened language to reflect local constraints (university environment).
- I edited estimates and linked stories to NFRs and test IDs.
- I removed any recommendations that referenced proprietary tools and replaced with neutral test IDs (e.g., T-PERF-01).

Sensitive data:
- No sensitive or confidential stakeholder data was included in prompts.
